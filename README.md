how to build a new jspm library like this

    jspm install
    jspm install rsvp=github:tildeio/rsvp.js@3.0.7 -o "{main: 'lib/rsvp.js'}"

    cd jspm_packages/github/tildeio/rsvp.js@3.0.7
    mv rsvp.js rsvp.js.js
    cd -

    jspm bundle final wat.js
    
    //next open wat.js and manually remove any react@0.10 System.register block
    //notice we don't bundle prefinal because it's included in the original bundle of the consumer

The intent behind this module (long term) is to show how jspm can bundle without react

**What I did to build the config file/package.json file (when I started the library)**

    jspm install promise-mixin=github:toranb/toranb-react-amd-rsvp-promise-mixin@0.1.2
    jspm install react=npm:react@0.10.0
